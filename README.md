The goal of this laboratory experience was to design, implement and validate a longitudinal
state–space controller for the two–wheeled balancing robot (also referred as “two–wheeled
inverted pendulum robot”, or “Segway–like robot”) available in laboratory. The aim of the
controller is to be able to stabilize the robot body to its upward vertical position while keeping
the robot base in a specific longitudinal position set-point, namely if the robot gets moved
or shifted it should be able to return to the initial position. The design of the controller was
performed by resorting to a simplified model of the robot dynamics, in which the motion occurs
along a straight line, thus ignoring the lateral or heading–angle dynamics.
